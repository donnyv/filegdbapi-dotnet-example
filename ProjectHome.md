I have created this project for anyone wanting to use the new [FileGDBAPI](http://blogs.esri.com/Dev/blogs/geodatabase/archive/2011/02/09/File-Geodatabase-API-download-updated-_2D00_-Beta-2.aspx) in **DotNet**.
The project includes an example C++ project that acts as a wrapper around the FileGDBAPI dll. It also has a test WinForms C# project that references the wrapper and creates a brand new file geodatabase. The wrapper is a CLR C++ project, so any DotNet language can use it.

I hope this helps get anyones project moving using the new FileGDBAPI. ;-)

**Currently built on the FileGDB API beta2 release.**
